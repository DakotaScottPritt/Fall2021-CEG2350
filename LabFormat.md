- It may be convenient to bookmark this link for easy access.

### How to use

- The repositories created in this course are **private**. The only people with access are you, me, and the TAs for this course.
- Your answers to the labs are generally going to go in a `README.md` file in a folder corresponding to the lab number. Each lab may work a little differently and have you add additional files and folders.
- To `clone` the repository:
  - Click the green `Code` button
  - Select `HTTPS` for username + password authentication or `SSH` for SSH key authentication
    - Ask in class, the Discord channel, or lab for assistance
  - In a terminal use `git clone` followed by the corresponding URL to clone your repository
